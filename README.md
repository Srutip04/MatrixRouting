## A delivery app that  calculates the shortest distance from each drop off spot. Used TomTom Map SDK for Web, to show  the best route for us as the delivery driver, to drop off all three deliveries based on time, taking:  
-  The route into account  
- The traffic on the roads into account.  
- The traffic incidents on the roads into account.
## The final route is calculated using the “Routing API” which by default will do a “car”  route. It can calculate the routes for motorcycles, vans, trucks or pedestrians!
